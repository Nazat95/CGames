Things we did this past week:
As a group, we completed our prototype, with buttons for user sign-in, assignments, and a leaderboard
Also, we filmed a prototype video, uploaded it to youtube, and updated our readme accordingly 
Topics Discussed:
1. Best way to fulfill user story for alpha release
2. Decided on focusing more on building fun games that teach the user about coding, as opposed to coding assignments
3. Redefined team roles to reflect the above changes in our project's focus
4. Implementing cookies or some other way to save user progress (to avoid dealing with google sign-in)
Tasks for Next Week:
Sai, Matt: brainstorm game design
Brian: clean up code and make template for Ben and Cory's assignment
Ben, Cory: brainstorm/write a first lesson and start adding it to the site
