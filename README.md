## Summary

### User story
I want a way to learn a programming language that is fun and feels like
playing a game.

### Minimal Viable Product (MVP)
We want the user to be able to press a button and then enter a game where
questions are asked regarding different python coding concepts. The user is
rewarded for correct answers and can proceed to the next part of the game upon
meeting a minimum point requirement. We want to incorporate a global
leaderboard so the user can compare scores with other users.

### Add-on features
1. Globe feature where each continent represents a different concept in Python
and each major city is a level. The user must visit every connecting city to
"beat" the continent and progress to the next one.
2. Incorporate more programming languages -- at first, our web app will only
give the option to learn one programming language (Python), additional
languages could be added to the web app later.
3. Ability to share a highscore to a social media account.

## Get started
To jump right into development, clone the project and run either `run.bat` or
`run.sh`, depending on your operating system. This will perform initial
installation and start a Flask web server running CGames.

However, we recommend that you use [JetBrains PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
when contributing to CGames, as CGames has been built from the ground up using
PyCharm. Clone the project using PyCharm (as a new project) and everything
should Just Work.
