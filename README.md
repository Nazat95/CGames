## Summary

### User story
I want a way to learn a programming language that is fun and feels like
playing a game.

### Minimal Viable Product (MVP)
We want the user to be able to press a button and then enter a game where
questions are asked regarding different python coding concepts. The user is
rewarded for correct answers and can proceed to the next part of the game upon
meeting a minimum point requirement. We want to incorporate a global
leaderboard so the user can compare scores with other users.

### Add-on features
1. Globe feature where each continent represents a different concept in Python
and each major city is a level. The user must visit every connecting city to
"beat" the continent and progress to the next one.
2. Incorporate more programming languages -- at first, our web app will only
give the option to learn one programming language (Python), additional
languages could be added to the web app later.
3. Ability to share a highscore to a social media account.

## Get started
1. Obtain your own OAuth 2.0 credentials for the Google API using
[this guide](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2).
2. Clone the project from GitHub.
3. In the repository directory, open `run.sh` or `run.bat` (depending on your
operating system) and modify the proper lines near the top of the file to 
configure your OAuth 2.0 credentials.
4. Run the server using either `run.sh` or `run.bat`.
