CSE 442 project for Spring 2018.

**User Story:** I want a way to learn a programming language that is fun and feels like playing a game

**Project Description:**

**MVP:** We want the user to be able to press a button and then enter a game where questions are asked regarding different python coding concepts. The user is rewarded for correct answers and can proceed to the next part of the game upon meeting a minimum point requirement. We want to incorporate a global leaderboard so the user can compare scores with other users.

**Add-On Features:*** 
  1. Globe feature where each continent represents a different concept in python and each major city is a level. The user must visit every connecting city to “beat” the continent and progress to the next one. 
  2. Incorporate more programming languages -- at first, our web app will only give the option to learn one programming language (python), additional languages could be added to the web app later
  3. Ability to share a highscore to a social media account
